# TheCatAPI
Small demo of CRUD operaticons in remote server by API.

First. 
Download the project.

Second. 
Open the .html in chrome or mozilla.

Third.
Try the CRUD operations. 


Note: Is required to get a token from the api to use it, but in my projects it's provided. 
The API offers up to 10.000 random cat pics, if someone overpasses it will be required to get a new token. 
Don`t worry, the first 10.000 pics are free.
